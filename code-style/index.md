# Salesforce Style Guide

## Purpose

This document describes a set of rules and conventions for source code and metadata. Having a common coding 
style makes it easier to understand and maintain source code that has been developed by more than one programmer, 
and makes it easier for multiple people to collaborate when developing software.

The coding standards described in this document are mandatory for all projects, unless there is an explicit 
requirement to use third-party coding standards.

All rules must be described using [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
